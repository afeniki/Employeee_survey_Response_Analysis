**Employee Survey Analysis and Insights**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes employee survey responses to identify key insights related to job satisfaction, leadership effectiveness, and organizational structure. The data is visualized using Power BI to support HR decision-making and improve workforce engagement.

**Key Insights**

1. Job Expectations Clarity: Employees generally understand their roles, but overall job satisfaction scores remain moderate (avg. 3.0/5).

2. Departmental Satisfaction: The Council’s Office has the highest satisfaction score (3.41), while District Court has the lowest (2.95).

3. Management-to-Staff Ratio: The Sheriff’s Department has an imbalanced leadership structure, potentially leading to inefficiencies.

4. Leadership Effectiveness: Some departments have too many supervisors while others lack sufficient leadership support.

5. Communication Gaps: Employees may feel disconnected from leadership, leading to lower engagement levels.

**Recommendations**

1. Enhance Job Satisfaction: Implement recognition programs, career growth opportunities, and work-life balance initiatives.

2. Optimize Leadership Structure: Reallocate managerial roles, improve delegation, and increase manager-staff interactions.

3. Improve Leadership Effectiveness: Conduct leadership training and rebalance supervisors across departments.

4. Boost Employee Engagement: Introduce team-building activities, regular town halls, and anonymous feedback mechanisms.

5. Enhance Cross-Department Collaboration: Promote best practices from high-performing teams and foster interdepartmental cooperation.

**Tools Used**

1. Power BI – Data visualization and analysis

2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom calculations and measures

3. Excel – Data preprocessing and cleaning (if applicable)



**Future Enhancements**

1. Integrate real-time survey data updates.

2. Apply sentiment analysis for open-ended employee feedback.

3. Develop predictive models to forecast employee engagement trends.
